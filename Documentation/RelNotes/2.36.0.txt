Git 2.36 Release Notes
======================

Updates since Git 2.35
----------------------

Backward compatibility warts

 * "git name-rev --stdin" has been deprecated and issues a warning
   when used; use "git name-rev --annotate-stdin" instead.

 * "git clone --filter=... --recurse-submodules" only makes the
   top-level a partial clone, while submodules are fully cloned.  This
   behaviour is changed to pass the same filter down to the submodules.


Note to those who build from the source

 *


UI, Workflows & Features

 * Assorted updates to "git cat-file", especially "-h".

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) learns to complete
   arguments to give to "git sparse-checkout" command.

 * "git log --remerge-diff" shows the difference from mechanical merge
   result and the result that is actually recorded in a merge commit.

 * "git log" and friends learned an option --exclude-first-parent-only
   to propagate UNINTERESTING bit down only along the first-parent
   chain, just like --first-parent option shows commits that lack the
   UNINTERESTING bit only along the first-parent chain.

 * The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned to
   complete all Git subcommands, including the ones that are normally
   hidden, when GIT_COMPLETION_SHOW_ALL_COMMANDS is used.

 * "git branch" learned the "--recurse-submodules" option.

 * A not-so-common mistake is to write a script to feed "git bisect
   run" without making it executable, in which case all tests will
   exit with 126 or 127 error codes, even on revisions that are marked
   as good.  Try to recognize this situation and stop iteration early.

 * When "index-pack" dies due to incoming data exceeding the maximum
   allowed input size, include the value of the limit in the error
   message.

 * The error message given by "git switch HEAD~4" has been clarified
   to suggest the "--detach" option that is required.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git apply" (ab)used the util pointer of the string-list to keep
   track of how each symbolic link needs to be handled, which has been
   simplified by using strset.

 * Fix a hand-rolled alloca() imitation that may have violated
   alignment requirement of data being sorted in compatibility
   implementation of qsort_s() and stable qsort().

 * Use the parse-options API in "git reflog" command.

 * The conditional inclusion mechanism of configuration files using
   "[includeIf <condition>]" learns to base its decision on the
   URL of the remote repository the repository interacts with.
   (merge 399b198489 jt/conditional-config-on-remote-url later to maint).

 * "git name-rev --stdin" does not behave like usual "--stdin" at
   all.  Start the process of renaming it to "--annotate-stdin".
   (merge a2585719b3 jc/name-rev-stdin later to maint).

 * "git update-index", "git checkout-index", and "git clean" are
   taught to work better with the sparse checkout feature.

 * Use an internal call to reset_head() helper function instead of
   spawning "git checkout" in "rebase", and update code paths that are
   involved in the change.

 * Messages "ort" merge backend prepares while dealing with conflicted
   paths were unnecessarily confusing since it did not differentiate
   inner merges and outer merges.

 * Small modernization of the rerere-train script (in contrib/).

 * Use designated initializers we started using in mid 2017 in more
   parts of the codebase that are relatively quiescent.


Fixes since v2.35
-----------------

 * "rebase" and "stash" in secondary worktrees are broken in
   Git 2.35.0, which has been corrected.

 * "git pull --rebase" ignored the rebase.autostash configuration
   variable when the remote history is a descendant of our history,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 3013d98d7a pb/pull-rebase-autostash-fix later to maint).

 * "git update-index --refresh" has been taught to deal better with
   racy timestamps (just like "git status" already does).
   (merge 2ede073fd2 ms/update-index-racy later to maint).

 * Avoid tests that are run under GIT_TRACE2 set from failing
   unnecessarily.
   (merge 944d808e42 js/test-unset-trace2-parents later to maint).

 * The merge-ort misbehaved when merge.renameLimit configuration is
   set too low and failed to find all renames.
   (merge 9ae39fef7f en/merge-ort-restart-optim-fix later to maint).

 * We explain that revs come first before the pathspec among command
   line arguments, but did not spell out that dashed options come
   before other args, which has been corrected.
   (merge c11f95010c tl/doc-cli-options-first later to maint).

 * "git add -p" rewritten in C regressed hunk splitting in some cases,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 7008ddc645 pw/add-p-hunk-split-fix later to maint).

 * "git fetch --negotiate-only" is an internal command used by "git
   push" to figure out which part of our history is missing from the
   other side.  It should never recurse into submodules even when
   fetch.recursesubmodules configuration variable is set, nor it
   should trigger "gc".  The code has been tightened up to ensure it
   only does common ancestry discovery and nothing else.
   (merge de4eaae63a gc/fetch-negotiate-only-early-return later to maint).

 * The code path that verifies signatures made with ssh were made to
   work better on a system with CRLF line endings.
   (merge caeef01ea7 fs/ssh-signing-crlf later to maint).

 * "git sparse-checkout init" failed to write into $GIT_DIR/info
   directory when the repository was created without one, which has
   been corrected to auto-create it.
   (merge 7f44842ac1 jt/sparse-checkout-leading-dir-fix later to maint).

 * Cloning from a repository that does not yet have any branches or
   tags but has other refs resulted in a "remote transport reported
   error", which has been corrected.
   (merge dccea605b6 jt/clone-not-quite-empty later to maint).

 * Mark in various places in the code that the sparse index and the
   split index features are mutually incompatible.
   (merge 451b66c533 js/sparse-vs-split-index later to maint).

 * Update the logic to compute alignment requirement for our mem-pool.
   (merge e38bcc66d8 jc/mem-pool-alignment later to maint).

 * Pick a better random number generator and use it when we prepare
   temporary filenames.
   (merge 47efda967c bc/csprng-mktemps later to maint).

 * Update the contributor-facing documents on proposed log messages.
   (merge cdba0295b0 jc/doc-log-messages later to maint).

 * When "git fetch --prune" failed to prune the refs it wanted to
   prune, the command issued error messages but exited with exit
   status 0, which has been corrected.
   (merge c9e04d905e tg/fetch-prune-exit-code-fix later to maint).

 * Problems identified by Coverity in the reftable code have been
   corrected.
   (merge 01033de49f hn/reftable-coverity-fixes later to maint).

 * A bug that made multi-pack bitmap and the object order out-of-sync,
   making the .midx data corrupt, has been fixed.
   (merge f8b60cf99b tb/midx-bitmap-corruption-fix later to maint).

 * The build procedure has been taught to notice older version of zlib
   and enable our replacement uncompress2() automatically.
   (merge 07564773c2 ab/auto-detect-zlib-compress2 later to maint).

 * Interaction between fetch.negotiationAlgorithm and
   feature.experimental configuration variables has been corrected.
   (merge 714edc620c en/fetch-negotiation-default-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --diff-filter=aR" is now parsed correctly.
   (merge 75408ca949 js/diff-filter-negation-fix later to maint).

 * When "git subtree" wants to create a merge, it used "git merge" and
   let it be affected by end-user's "merge.ff" configuration, which
   has been corrected.
   (merge 9158a3564a tk/subtree-merge-not-ff-only later to maint).

 * Unlike "git apply", "git patch-id" did not handle patches with
   hunks that has only 1 line in either preimage or postimage, which
   has been corrected.
   (merge 757e75c81e jz/patch-id-hunk-header-parsing-fix later to maint).

 * "receive-pack" checks if it will do any ref updates (various
   conditions could reject a push) before received objects are taken
   out of the temporary directory used for quarantine purposes, so
   that a push that is known-to-fail will not leave crufts that a
   future "gc" needs to clean up.
   (merge 5407764069 cb/clear-quarantine-early-on-all-ref-update-errors later to maint).

 * Because a deletion of ref would need to remove it from both the
   loose ref store and the packed ref store, a delete-ref operation
   that logically removes one ref may end up invoking ref-transaction
   hook twice, which has been corrected.
   (merge 2ed1b64ebd ps/avoid-unnecessary-hook-invocation-with-packed-refs later to maint).

 * When there is no object to write .bitmap file for, "git
   multi-pack-index" triggered an error, instead of just skipping,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge eb57277ba3 tb/midx-no-bitmap-for-no-objects later to maint).

 * "git cmd -h" outside a repository should error out cleanly for many
   commands, but instead it hit a BUG(), which has been corrected.
   (merge 87ad07d735 js/short-help-outside-repo-fix later to maint).

 * "working tree" and "per-worktree ref" were in glossary, but
   "worktree" itself wasn't, which has been corrected.
   (merge 2df5387ed0 jc/glossary-worktree later to maint).

 * L10n support for a few error messages.
   (merge 3d3c23b3a7 bs/forbid-i18n-of-protocol-token-in-fetch-pack later to maint).

 * Test modernization.
   (merge d4fe066e4b sy/t0001-use-path-is-helper later to maint).

 * "git log --graph --graph" used to leak a graph structure, and there
   was no way to countermand "--graph" that appear earlier on the
   command line.  A "--no-graph" option has been added and resource
   leakage has been plugged.

 * Error output given in response to an ambiguous object name has been
   improved.
   (merge 3a73c1dfaf ab/ambiguous-object-name later to maint).

 * "git sparse-checkout" wants to work with per-worktree configuration,
   but did not work well in a worktree attached to a bare repository.
   (merge 3ce1138272 ds/sparse-checkout-requires-per-worktree-config later to maint).

 * Setting core.untrackedCache to true failed to add the untracked
   cache extension to the index.

 * Workaround we have for versions of PCRE2 before their version 10.36
   were in effect only for their versions newer than 10.36 by mistake,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 97169fc361 rs/pcre-invalid-utf8-fix-fix later to maint).

 * Document Taylor as a new member of Git PLC at SFC.  Welcome.
   (merge e8d56ca863 tb/coc-plc-update later to maint).

 * "git checkout -b branch/with/multi/level/name && git stash" only
   recorded the last level component of the branch name, which has
   been corrected.

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge cfc5cf428b jc/find-header later to maint).
   (merge 40e7cfdd46 jh/p4-fix-use-of-process-error-exception later to maint).
